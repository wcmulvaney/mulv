The author sat down at his desk. By the light of his lamp he began to write: It was a dark and stormy night. Suddenly Charlie Brown slaps Snoopy in the back of the head and said, "Come on Snoopy, it is time to go to the vet."
Snoopy did not want to go to the vet. He recalled his last experience at the vet: the doctor's cold hands, the sharp needle he had been poked with, the flickering lights. He would do anything to avoid going back.
He was not ready for the out of body experience he had. He had meet an entire new version human. It was horrid. 

The author sat up abruptly. For just an instant he had felt Snoopy's terror as his own. The story would need to change.
